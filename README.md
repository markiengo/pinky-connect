# Crambox

Crambox is a study companion for Vietnamese university students. It helps you find the right practice exams, take quizzes, review explanations, and track your progress across subjects -- all in one place.

You type what you need, upload your materials, and Crambox matches you with relevant exams from the question bank. No guesswork, no scrolling through random forums.

## How It Works

1. **Ask for what you need.** Type a prompt like "Cho minh de Ke toan ve BCTC" or upload a PDF of your class notes.
2. **Get matched.** Crambox reads your input, detects the subject and topics, and returns the most relevant exam papers from the database.
3. **Practice.** Take quizzes with instant feedback on multiple-choice questions and model answers for essay questions.
4. **Track progress.** Every attempt is saved. Your dashboard shows score trends, subject averages, and recent activity.

## What You Can Do

- Search for exams by typing a question or uploading a PDF
- Browse the full exam library, filtered by subject
- Take quizzes with MCQ and essay questions
- See detailed explanations after each question (inline, no modal popup)
- View score progression over time
- Compare performance across subjects
- Manage your profile and review full attempt history
- Preview pricing tiers (Free, Plus, Pro)
- Multi-chat sessions in the chatbox (in-memory, ephemeral)

## Subjects Covered

- **Ke toan** -- Accounting principles, financial statements
- **Tai chinh -- Ngan hang** -- Finance and banking
- **Quan tri kinh doanh** -- Business administration, marketing, strategy
- **Kinh te vi mo** -- Microeconomics, market structures, consumer theory
- **Phap luat dai cuong** -- Constitutional, civil, commercial, and administrative law

## Getting Started

### Local Development (SQLite)

Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file (see `.env.example`):

```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db"
JWT_SECRET="dev-secret-do-not-use-in-production"
PORT=3001
```

Push schema and seed the database:

```powershell
npx prisma db push --skip-generate
npm run seed
```

Start the dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3001 in your browser.

### Production Deployment (Railway + Supabase)

The app uses SQLite for local dev and PostgreSQL (Supabase) in production. Railway's build step auto-swaps the Prisma provider from `sqlite` to `postgresql`.

1. Push the repo to GitHub.
2. Create a Railway project from the GitHub repo.
3. Set environment variables in Railway:
   - `DATABASE_URL` -- Supabase direct connection string (e.g. `postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@db.[PROJECT_REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres`)
   - `JWT_SECRET` -- a strong random secret
4. Railway builds and deploys automatically. The Supabase database is already seeded -- no migration or seed step needed on deploy.

## Demo Accounts

Both local and production use the same accounts:

```text
huyenmy / my1234      premium account
pinky   / pinky1234   basic account
```

## Scripts

```powershell
npm run dev     # Start dev server on port 3001 (Turbopack)
npm run build   # Generate Prisma client and build for production
npm run start   # Start production server
npm run seed    # Seed local SQLite database (3,000 questions, 150 de_thi, 5 subjects, 2 users)
npm run lint    # Run ESLint
npx vitest run  # Run unit tests (35 tests across vietnamese, subject-detection, matching)
```

## Tech

- Next.js 16 with App Router (Turbopack dev)
- React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4
- Prisma with SQLite (local dev) / PostgreSQL via Supabase (production)
- JWT sessions with jose, password hashing with bcryptjs
- Recharts for analytics, pdf-parse for PDF text extraction
- react-markdown + remark-math + rehype-katex for math rendering
- Vitest for unit tests

## Notes

- The search engine is deterministic and zero-cost. No paid LLM or embedding API is used in the current version.
- Auth is username/password (no OAuth). Sessions are JWT in httpOnly cookies.
- Dev mode: session cookie is session-only (cleared on browser close). Production: 7-day maxAge.
- Dev mode: auto-logout on hard refresh / tab close via `pagehide` event + `sendBeacon`.
- `.env` and local build artifacts are gitignored. Set environment variables on your deployment platform.
- Use a strong `JWT_SECRET` in production. The default dev secret is not secure.
- Local dev uses SQLite. Railway's build step (`railway.json`) auto-swaps the Prisma provider to `postgresql` and connects to Supabase.
